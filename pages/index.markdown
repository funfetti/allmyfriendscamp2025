# all my friends camping weekend

> #### September 26-28 2025 <br> Camp Dan Beard, Northbrook, IL

## What even is this?

I rented out the *entirety* of a Cook County campground, [Camp Dan Beard](https://fpdcc.com/places/locations/camp-dan-beard/), for the last weekend in September! Let's hang out, but outsiiiideeeee.

There are showers and bathrooms, a nice paved pavilion with picnic tables, fire pits, a huge meadow to pitch tents, and a few basic cabins (literally four walls and bunk beds). There's also a Westin and Holiday Inn around the corner lol. 

We can bring grills, speakers, projectors, kegs of beer, lawn games, etc. I'm envisioning that people can camp out for both days or just come hang out during the day (Dan Beard is ~1 hr from the loop). Kids are welcome! 

## How much is this going to cost?
TBD. I'm aiming for about $50 per day per person. (We'll need 30 people per day to achieve that.) I'm hoping to split the rental cost. The whole weekend was roughly 3k so the more folks that come the cheaper it'll be. 

I'll update once I figure out the fairest/easiest way to split it up.

## How do I get a cabin spot?
TBD, but I'll probably make a signup sheet (first come, first serve) and I'll charge more than folks that want to pitch a tent.

## Wait I have more questions...
Totally get it. So do I. Keep an eye on this space and I'll send out info blasts via the partiful as I figure stuff out.
